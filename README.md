# Axon-AI-bot

Axon AI bot's face is a responsive, animated landing experience that communicates the brand's calm confidence and guides visitors through Axon's mission, capabilities, and personas.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the experience. All assets are bundled locally aside from the ambient audio track and Google Fonts.

### Features

- **Adaptive theming** – Automatic detection of system preference with manual light/dark toggle.
- **Animated avatar** – Breathing pulses and greeting motion establish Axon's visual identity.
- **Persona explorer** – Sample responses and a demo panel to illustrate strategist, researcher, and companion modes.
- **Scroll choreography** – Intersection-based reveal animations for content cards and trust timeline.
- **Ambient mission brief** – Optional audio to set the tone for Axon's mission overview.
